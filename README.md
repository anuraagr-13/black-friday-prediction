# Black Friday Prediction

Prediction of the 'Purchase' variable of the Black Friday dataset.
The application consists of first pre-processing and then application of several supervised learning algorithms. 
The metric to judge the regression was RMSE. However, we also utilized cross-validation to check if this fact is true on a test dataset. 

Steps:

- Python 1 : Exploratory Data Analysis
- Python 2 : Pre-Processing
- Python 3 : Supervised Learning Algorithms
- Python 4 : Rule Based Learning

Utilized apriori analysis to rules to find predictions for high purchase values. Applied regression tree on the pruned tree to get RMSE values.
